        # If you want to add any widgets to this tab, you can set up a layout here and add them.
        # For now, it's just an empty tab.

        # Example of adding a layout:
        # layout = QVBoxLayout(self)
        # self.setLayout(layout)

        # Example of adding a label to the layout:
        # placeholder_label = QLabel("This is just a placeholder.")
        # layout.addWidget(placeholder_label)

        # You can also set up buttons, text fields, and other widgets as needed.
