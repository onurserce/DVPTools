# Notes before generating the SQL query

- There's a photo, it includes what needs to be included in the query
- Slide A -> last two are good, especially the last one
- Slide B -> Second section looks very nice
- PG/shapes ratio is good for 100 - 250 - 500 shapes. In case there's a limitation in the material...
- Slide B looks a little bit better with just one expected air bubble

Regions 6 and up on slide B exclude intense cFOS stainings
instead of 'Region features' use 'Region features_cfos'
